# Simple Interest Calculator

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple interest calculator that calculates interest based on principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.

## 🧮 Formula Used
Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate basic mathematical calculation using programming logic.

## 📥 Inputs
- Principal Amount (P)
- Rate of Interest (R)
- Time Period (T)

## 📤 Output
- Calculated Simple Interest

## 💻 Example
If:
P = 1000
R = 5%
T = 2 years

Simple Interest = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 100

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Enter the principal amount.
2. Enter the rate of interest.
3. Enter the time period.
4. The calculator will display the simple interest.
